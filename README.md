# blackboard-grade-percentages

Chrome extension to show grades in blackboard.com courses as percentages rather than fractions

Most school districts use percentages of 100% as grades. Blackboard.com use fractions instead which require extra mental
math to determine what grade (A,B,C,D,F). This extension allows for toggling on conversion to percentages so that you 
and/or your child can more easily determine where they stand on each assignment grade.

It will also show all overall course grades on the class list page so you don't have to dive into each course's
My Grades page to see the overall grade.
